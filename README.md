# CV_ImageClassification
Toy dataset Image Classification using Pytorch

Model 1. Neural Network
● How many trainable parameters are in the model? It is printed in the terminal. → There are 346373 parameters in this model
● What is the best training accuracy? → train Accuracy: 75.816%
● What is the best validation accuracy? Is it better than the ones in the previous questions?
→ valid Accuracy: 76.72%
● According to the training and validation accuracies, does the model overfit your training
data?
→ No, it is not overfitting. If it were overfitting, training accuracy should be much higher than validation accuracy.


Model 2. Simple Convolution Neural Network
● How many trainable parameters are in the model? It is printed in the terminal. → There are 8069 parameters in this model
● What is the best training accuracy? → train Accuracy: 83.456 %
● What is the best validation accuracy? Is it better than the ones in the previous questions?
→ valid Accuracy: 82.6800%. Yes, it is better than the previous question.
● According to the training and validation accuracies, does the model overfit your training
data?
→ Yes, training accuracy is higher than validation accuracy.
